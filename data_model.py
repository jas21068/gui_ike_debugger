Here's a summary:\n\nScenario: The IKEv2 tunnel initially comes up and functions normally, but during an IPsec rekey, the tunnel goes down, causing traffic disruption. This issue arises due to a PFS mismatch.\n\nTraffic Selectors: If multiple traffic selectors are configured, the first traffic selector pair comes up during the IKE_AUTH negotiations, but subsequent traffic selectors do not come up during the CREATE_CHILD_SA negotiations.\n\nMisconfiguration: The tunnel comes up initially because there is only one traffic selector (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 to 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0). The first IPsec SA comes up as part of completing the IKE_AUTH exchange, but PFS settings are not exchanged in IKE_AUTH.\n\nIPsec Rekey: During an IPsec rekey, the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange is used, and this is when the PFS settings are sent to the peer. If there is a mismatch, the rekey fails, and the tunnel goes down.\n\nSolution: To resolve this issue, the IKEv2 IPsec tunnel must be configured properly with matching PFS settings at both ends.\n\nThe section also provides sample debug logs for both the initiator and responder during the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, illustrating the process and the errors encountered due to the PFS mismatch."

            "context": "The \"Clock skew issue\" in SAML on FortiGate occurs when there's a significant time difference between the Service Provider (SP) and Identity Provider (IdP). SAML assertions have timestamps and validity periods, so a mismatch in system time can lead to authentication failures.\n\nPossible Causes:\n\nTime Mismatch: The most common cause is that the clocks on the SP (FortiGate) and IdP are not synchronized. If the time difference exceeds the allowed skew tolerance, the SAML assertion is considered invalid.\nTimezone Issues: Ensure both the SP and IdP are using the same time zone or correctly adjusted for time zone differences.\nNTP Configuration: If either side is not using a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for time synchronization, the clocks can drift out of sync, leading to this error.",

Ensure both SP and IdP systems have matching or near-identical time settings.\nVerify Time Zone Settings:\n\nDouble-check the time zone settings on both the SP and IdP. Ensure both systems are aligned with the correct timezone, or explicitly adjust them to be the same.\nReview SAML Assertion Settings:\n\nCheck the SAML configuration on both ends to ensure they allow for a reasonable amount of clock skew tolerance (usually a few minutes).\nConsider adjusting the allowed skew tolerance on both the SP and IdP if the systems have some intentional time drift.\nOn the Fortigate, skew tolerance can be configured under 'config user saml'\nExamine Logs and Retry:\n\nAfter making time adjustments, examine the logs for any residual time-related issues.

            "context": "The \"Failed to verify signature\" error in FortiGates SAML configuration typically occurs when the certificate referenced in the SAML configuration doesn't match the one used by the Identity Provider (IdP) for signing SAML assertions.

Verify that the FortiGate device points to the exact certificate from the IdP that is used for signing SAML assertions.\n\nExample: If the certificate being used is \"ADFS-IDP,\" but the actual signing certificate is \"GOOGLE-IDP,\" the signature will fail to verify.\nObtain Correct IdP Certificate:\n\nConfirm the IdP certificate used to sign the assertions by checking the IdP configuration. This may be an X.509 certificate, often available through the IdP's metadata or admin interface.\nDownload or copy the correct certificate.\nVerify the SAML Assertion: If possible, inspect the SAML assertion being sent from the IdP to ensure it is signed using the expected certificate. If you can capture the raw SAML response, check for the signature header and confirm it matches the expected signing certificate.\n\nCertificate Validity: Make sure that the certificate is valid (not expired, revoked, or missing required fields like the public key). Cross-check this with the IdPs certificate.\n\nMatch the Certificate Fingerprint: Validate the fingerprint (SHA1 or SHA256) of the certificate used by the IdP matches the one specified in the FortiGate configuration. This ensures no changes have been made to the certificate since initial setup.\n\nCertificate Trust Chain: Ensure that the entire certificate trust chain is valid. If the certificate is signed by a certificate authority (CA), ensure the CA certificates are properly installed on the FortiGate.\n\nReconfigure SAML Settings: In case of a mismatch, update the SAML configuration in FortiGate to refer to the correct certificate by executing:\n\nbash\nCopy\nEdit\nconfig user saml\n   edit \"<SAML-Profile>\"\n   set idp-cert \"<Correct-Certificate-Name>\"\nend\nReview Configuration Documentation: Cross-check FortiGates SAML setup with both the device and IdPs documentation to ensure you are following the best practices for certificate usage and SAML setup.\n\nCheck for Multiple Profiles: If there are multiple SAML profiles or IdP configurations, ensure that the correct certificate is referenced for each profile to avoid cross-confusion.\n\nBy following these steps, you can correct the \"Failed to verify signature\" error caused by misconfigured or mismatched certificates in FortiGates SAML settings."
